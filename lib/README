installing pyspatialite:
	
	pip install lib/pyspatialite-blahblahblah

installing spatialite:

DON'T USE 4.1 -- pyspatialite uses 3.x so use that
need to build libspatialite from source to get 3.x
then to link, make sure pkgconfig/pkg-config is good to go:

export "PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig"
pkg-config --libs spatialite
